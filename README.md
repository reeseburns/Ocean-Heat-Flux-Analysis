# Ocean-Heat-Flux-Analysis

### *Research Goal*
We aim to analyze the change over time (from 1992-2015) of *latent heat flux* in the ocean's surface based on factors like *sea surface salinity* and *temperature*.

### *About the Data*
The real-world data used for our modeling comes from the *Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)* project and *National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)*. All datasets are specifically referenced in the article ["Global Reconstruction of Historical Ocean Heat Storage and Transport"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1808838115) (Zanna et al. 19).

1. **ECCO Datasets:** Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) & Temperature (SST)
2. **NCEI Dataset:** Latent Heat Flux (LHTFL)

Each dataset includes columns for timestamp (year-month-day) ranginge from 1955-2017, lattitude, longitude, and the respective variable (e.g. salinity, temperature, or latent heat flux). 

### *Our Work*
Take a look at our "analysis.ipynb" to see how we analyzed the influence of *sea surface salinity* and *temperature* on *latent heat flux* of the ocean's surface. 

Take a look at our paper "EACOceans_Paper.pdf" to learn more about our all-encompassing project that tackles how the ocean as a whole affects climate.
