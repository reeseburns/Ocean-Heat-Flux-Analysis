# Ocean-Heat-Flux-Analysis

The ocean is a vast and dynamic force, shaping Earth's climate through heat absorption, circulation, and feedback loops. 

### *Research Goal*
We explore its critical role, from surface fluxes to deep-water currents, using research and data analysis to uncover how oceans regulate global temperatures and respond to climate change. In our analysis, we aim to analyze the change over time (from 1992-2015) of *latent heat flux* in the ocean's surface based on factors like *sea surface salinity* and *temperature*.

### *About the Data*
The real-world data used for our modeling are specifically referenced in the article ["Global Reconstruction of Historical Ocean Heat Storage and Transport"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1808838115) (Zanna et al. 19).

1. **ECCO Datasets:** Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) & Temperature (SST)
2. **NCEI Dataset:** Latent Heat Flux (LHTFL)

### *Our Work*
1. Take a look at our [analysis](HeatFlux_Analysis.ipynb) to see how we analyzed the influence of *sea surface salinity* and *temperature* on *latent heat flux* of the ocean's surface.

2. Take a look at our [report](OceansClimate_Paper.pdf) to learn more about our all-encompassing project that tackles how the ocean as a whole affects climate.
